Code for data analysis and simulations accompanying the publication [arXiv:2108.01086](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01086).

Clone repository and run notebooks in your own Jupyter instance or click binder button above to run on other people's computers (aka 'the cloud'). Note that most computations take rather long on the public BinderHub infrastructure and are best performed locally.

  * `MM-DD`: folders with raw data, named by date in 2021.
  * `U1 Simulations.ipynb`: Numerical simulations. Produces files for `U1 Figures.ipynb` too.
  * `U1 Figures.ipynb`: Data analysis for Figures appearing in paper.
  * `KiCad_U1-block/`: Schematic and PCB design.
  * `redpitaya-measurements/`: Measurement scripts used with Red Pitaya.
